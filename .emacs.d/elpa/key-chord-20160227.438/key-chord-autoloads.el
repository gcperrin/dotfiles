Toggle key chord mode.
With positive ARG enable the mode. With zero or negative arg disable the mode.
A key chord is two keys that are pressed simultaneously, or one key quickly
pressed twice.

See functions `key-chord-define-global', `key-chord-define-local', and
`key-chord-define' and variables `key-chord-two-keys-delay' and
`key-chord-one-key-delay'.

(autoload 'key-chord-define-global "key-chord" "\
Define a key-chord of the two keys in KEYS starting a COMMAND.

KEYS can be a string or a vector of two elements. Currently only elements
that corresponds to ascii codes in the range 32 to 126 can be used.

COMMAND can be an interactive function, a string, or nil.
If COMMAND is nil, the key-chord is removed.

Note that KEYS defined locally in the current buffer will have precedence.

\(fn KEYS COMMAND)" t nil)

(autoload 'key-chord-define-local "key-chord" "\
Locally define a key-chord of the two keys in KEYS starting a COMMAND.

KEYS can be a string or a vector of two elements. Currently only elements
that corresponds to ascii codes in the range 32 to 126 can be used.

COMMAND can be an interactive function, a string, or nil.
If COMMAND is nil, the key-chord is removed.

The binding goes in the current buffer's local map,
which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.

Define in KEYMAP, a key-chord of the two keys in KEYS starting a COMMAND.

KEYS can be a string or a vector of two elements. Currently only elements

COMMAND can be an interactive function, a string, or nil.
